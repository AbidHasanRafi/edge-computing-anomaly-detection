## 2. ESP32 Anomaly Detection Server

The `esp32-anomaly-detection-server` is an Arduino-based project designed to simulate anomaly data transmission from an ESP32 microcontroller.

### Directory Structure

```
esp32-anomaly-detection-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ diagram.json        # Circuit diagram (Wokwi format)
â”œâ”€â”€ libraries.txt       # Required libraries for the ESP32 project
â”œâ”€â”€ sketch.ino          # Main Arduino code for the ESP32
â””â”€â”€ wokwi-project.txt   # Wokwi project link
```

### Features

- Simulates anomaly detection by generating and sending data to the server.
- Provides a practical demonstration of IoT and edge computing concepts.

### View or Run the Project

- **Run on Wokwi:** [Wokwi Simulator](https://wokwi.com)

### Installation and Usage

1. **Upload the Sketch:**

   - Open `sketch.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Install required libraries listed in `libraries.txt`.
   - Connect your ESP32 and upload the code.

2. **Circuit Setup:**

   - Use the `diagram.json` to set up your circuit in Wokwi or on a physical breadboard.

3. **Simulate Data:**
   - The ESP32 will send POST requests with anomaly data to the server.

Hereâ€™s the updated README text with a detailed explanation of which light is lit based on the status shown in the figures:

### ESP-32 Circuit Simulation

The figure below shows the circuit simulation when the ESP-32 detects normal power readings. The green LED is lit to indicate normal operation, signaling that no anomalies are currently detected.

The figure below shows the circuit simulation when the ESP-32 detects an anomaly in the power readings. The blue LED is lit to signify an anomaly, alerting the user to unusual power consumption.

### ESP-32 Server Functionality

The ESP-32 server is designed to simulate power readings from an electric meter and send anomaly data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests. It also hosts a local web server to manage LED states and display real-time data on an OLED screen. Key features include:

1. **Wi-Fi Connectivity**:

   - Connects to a predefined Wi-Fi network (`WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`).
   - Retrieves and prints the ESP-32's IP address on successful connection.

2. **Power Reading Simulation**:

   - Generates random power readings between 500 and 1000 units.
   - Uses the `isAnomaly()` function to randomly flag anomalies (30% probability).
   - Anomalies are marked for further processing and visualization.

3. **Anomaly Data Transmission**:

   - Sends detected anomalies and their associated power readings to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.
   - Data is structured in JSON format using the ArduinoJson library.

4. **Local Web Server**:

   - Hosts a web server accessible from the ESP-32's local IP address.
   - Provides an interactive HTML page to toggle the state of two LEDs (blue and red).
   - URL patterns are dynamically handled using the `UriBraces` feature.

5. **LED Indications**:

   - Blue LED: Indicates an anomaly in power readings.
   - Green LED: Indicates normal power readings.
   - Red LED: Reserved for additional notifications or error signals.

6. **OLED Display**:

   - Displays the current power reading and its status (normal or anomalous) on an Adafruit SSD1306 OLED screen.
   - Provides visual feedback for both simulated data and anomaly detection.

7. **Data Streaming**:

   - Streams power readings and anomaly statuses for two minutes or until 10 anomalies are detected.
   - After the streaming period, the LEDs are turned off to conserve power.

8. **HTTP Server Routes**:
   - `/`: Returns an HTML interface to toggle LED states and view their status.
   - `/toggle/{LED}`: Toggles the state of the specified LED (blue or red).

### How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**:

   - Initializes Wi-Fi, OLED display, and GPIO pins for LEDs.
   - Starts the HTTP server and waits for client requests.

2. **Power Reading Loop**:

   - Simulates power readings at 10-second intervals.
   - Flags readings as anomalies using a probabilistic function.
   - Sends the flagged data to a remote server and updates the OLED display.

3. **Client Interaction**:

   - Users can toggle LED states using the provided web interface.
   - The server dynamically updates the HTML page to reflect the current LED states.

4. **End Condition**:
   - Stops streaming data after two minutes or 10 anomalies.
   - Resets LED states to off.

### How to Test the ESP-32 Server

1. **Setup Environment**:

   - Connect the ESP-32 to a Wi-Fi network.
   - Upload the sketch to the ESP-32 using the Arduino IDE.

2. **Access Web Interface**:

   - Open the ESP-32's IP address in a web browser.
   - Use the interface to toggle LED states.

3. **Monitor OLED Display**:

   - Observe real-time power readings and anomaly detection statuses.

4. **Check Server Integration**:
   - Update the `serverUrl` with the actual API endpoint.
   - Verify that anomaly data is being sent and received correctly.
